# Game_Playing_Agent_for_GO
This Project was part of CSCI 561 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence.

Built an AI agent for Go game of 5x5 board. Used custom heuristic function and implemented Minimax search with Alpha Beta Pruning to find the best moves for max depth of 7 ply.

It will take the board as an input from input.txt and print the best valid move in output.txt.
